# Real-Time Ethical Keylogger – Cybersecurity Audit Project

## Description
This project demonstrates advanced keystroke interception and data exfiltration techniques in a controlled, ethical environment. It uses an asynchronous event-driven architecture to monitor hardware-level keyboard events via a web interface.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Capture:** Uses WebSockets for instant logging of all keys (including Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Enter).
- **Direct DOM Binding:** Overcomes browser focus-traps to ensure continuous monitoring.
- **Consent-Driven:** Includes a mandatory user consent mechanism for ethical compliance.
- **Live Dashboard:** Features an integrated exfiltration feed for real-time data analysis.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.x
- **Framework:** NiceGUI (FastAPI-based)
- **Communication:** WebSockets (Bi-directional)
- **Deployment:** Render / Replit

## Ethical Notice
This project is strictly for educational purposes and cybersecurity awareness. It is localized to the application environment and does not intercept system-wide data outside the browser sandbox.

## Hosting

Hosted on **Render** providing a live URL(https://keylogger-cybersecurity-internship-kcse.onrender.com) for real-time evaluation.
